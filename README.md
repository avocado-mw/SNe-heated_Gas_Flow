My GitHub repository is based in https://github.com/avocado-mw/SNe-heated_Gas_Flow.
Most of the python codes and scripts, as well as Jupyter notebooks are inherited from Leo’s and Hollis’s. To see some larger files (ex. hdf5), you can head to watanabe@quirm.math.grinnell.edu/watanabe_MAP/SNe-heated_Gas_Flow. \n

I am a beginner in GitHub. So I had troubles setting up the local repository and connect it to the remote repository. There was issue referring the main branch of remote to local main branch and here’s the website I followed to fix the issue of receiving “nothing to commit” error even through I added files locally.
